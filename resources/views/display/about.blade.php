                            Hastakala is an platform for Nepali artists to show case their products. Now you can directly purchase Handicraft goods from manufacturers themselves from the comfort of your home.

                        <p>

                            We realized that unlike Nepalese & Tibetan culture our handicrafts across the world drew lot of attention and appreciation for their traditionalism, and aestheticism. However, there was a gap in the supply of the genuine, traditional Nepalese handicraft products in the market. We came up with the project Hastakala to provide the appreciators of Nepalese arts & craft a portal through which they could purchase ethnic Nepali handicraft products executed in traditional techniques, designs and colors. The idea was to make ethnic Nepalese Handicrafts accessible across the globe with a simple click on a mouse.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            Nepal being land of diverse cultures, languages, ethnicities and religions it has an amazing variety of handicraft products. We have selected and placed our products carefully to give you a wide variety of Nepali Handicraft with excellent quality products at best competitive rates. Explore your fascinating handicrafts store with all kinds of Art and crafts from Nepal.
